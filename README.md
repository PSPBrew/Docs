#### Introduction:
  This site is for folks who wish to get the most out of their PlayStation Portable by "jailbreaking" the console to be able to use applications, games and various other cool things made by the community. If you have not done much with PSP hacking I would suggest checking out the PSP Glossary
  

  
#### Why Custom Firmware?
    
Custom Firmware enables quite a lot of features, some listed below:



#### Glossary
* XMB - The PSP Menu System known as the Cross Menu Bar.
* Eboot - A Eboot is the executable file on the Playstation Portable like a .exe file on Windows or .app on Macs. 
* PRX - A PRX is also an executable file however cannot be executed from the XMB
