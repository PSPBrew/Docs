#### Introduction:
  This site is for folks who wish to get the most out of their PlayStation Portable by "jailbreaking" the console to be able to use applications, games and various other cool things made by the community. If you have not done much with PSP hacking I would suggest checking out the PSP Glossary




## General

  
#### Why Custom Firmware?
    
Custom Firmware enables quite a lot of features, some listed below:
* Unsupported Applications, Emulators, plugins and games will run.
* Access to a recovery menu
* Can switch X and O around 
* Lots more!

#### Signed Homebrew 
Signed homebrew is homebrew that will work without use of Custom Firmware and is generally used to modify the PSP in the first place. It has some major limitations and should only be used for software that:
* Does not have external PRX files attached as they will not work.


## Software

#### Hacking your PSP
NB: This assumes your PSP is not already permanently jailbroken. If your PSP is already running Custom Firmware I would suggest sticking with it if it is Firmware 5.00 or above unless you feel the need to update to 6.61.

You need:
* Your PSP
* A Memory Stick
* A Computer

Files you need:
* PSP Firmware 6.61
* Infinity v2 from http://infinity.lolhax.org
* 6.61 Pro-C:
	* Install the seplugins folder to the root / base directory of your memory stick
	* Install the PROUPDATE / FastRecovery folders into PSP/GAME

Step 1:
Place the PSP Firmware 6.61 Update file in PSP/GAME/UPDATE on your Memory Stick and run the update.

Step 2:
Replace the PSP Firmware 6.61 Update with the required Infinity update (All PSPS except PSP Go use the standard file)

Step 3:
Run the PRO-C Installer it may take a few times for it to work correctly.

Step 4: When PRO-C is successful, run the Infinity Installer. Follow directions on the screen. When that is complete run PRO-C Installer again and then run Infinity once more, select your custom firmware in the menu and now your PSP is jailbroken permanently unless undone.




#### Where do I put Homebrew?
Most Homebrew goes into the PSP/Game Folder on your Memory Stick. If it's a plugin it goes into the seplugins folder at the root of your Memory Stick

## Hardware
#### Pandora Battery
The Pandora Battery is used to recover compatible PSPS from a bricked state.

## MicroSD Card Adapters

### Standard PSPs (non-Go)

As genuine / new / working [Memory Sticks](https://playstationdev.wiki/pspdevwiki/index.php/Memory_stick) with large storage are getting expensive to buy it's recommended to use a MicroSD Adapter Solution.  

Generally, dual-slot Memory Stick to MicroSD adapters are unrecommended as they are slow and there is a risk of corrupted data.

It is also important to note that the XMB slows down naturally depending on the PSP's storage size. This is unavoidable and as such 32GB is considered to be the "golden" storage size.

[FunTurbo's MicroSD Card Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Funturbo-MagicGate-Playstation-Portable-Handycam/dp/B07F68FCHD/) is the recommended choice.

### PSP-Go    

The PSP-Go moved away from the Memory Stick Pro Duo in favor of the Memory Stick M2, a much smaller but more costly solution for expanded storage.

Due to the M2's size, there is no convienent solution for MicroSD card adapters. There is, however, the [M2 Dummy Adapter](https://playstationdev.wiki/pspdevwiki/index.php/M2_Dummy_Adapter).

The M2 Dummy Adapter is a ribbon cable that allows the M2 slot on the PSP-Go to interface with a MicroSD card OR a Memory Stick Pro Duo.

They are currently not being manufactured and it is unknown when or if production will resume. Be sure to check the `Where To Buy` section of the PSP dev wiki to see if this changes.
